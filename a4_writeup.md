# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The most difficult part was trying to think of a better way to see if somebody won and then giving up and writing every scenario.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

I would just have the computer try to make a random move next to one of its other pieces until the move was valid.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

I think that I would have it see if X is 1 away from a victory and if so block it. Other wise I would have it play a move towards a possible winning scenario.
